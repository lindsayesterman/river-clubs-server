# River Clubs

**The problem**

Eliona: "Sally, I've looked everywhere but I can't find information on what time our Girls Who Code club meeting is."
Sally: "Oh yeah, you have to watch the announcements today - which happen to be 20 minutes long - to find that piece of info. Sorry."

**The Solution** 

A directory containing all of River's Clubs' information.

The River Clubs website will store meeting times, meeting places, club descriptions, the google classroom and remind codes, and the leadership team. 

Now students can browse through clubs to join and find information regarding clubs they are already in. We no longer have to waste 20 minutes watching a video for 10 seconds of information.
